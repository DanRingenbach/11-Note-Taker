# 11-Note-Taker


## Description
For this project I created the back end code for a note-taking program that runs usinf *Express.js*.  The user is able to add notes to a database that saves them on the deployed site.

Through the building of this application I learned how to use *Express.js* and how to problem solve using *npm*.
